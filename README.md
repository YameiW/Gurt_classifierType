Code and data for GURT/SyntaxFest conference 2023
The main analysis is done in the python notebook.

## Pickle files description
There are three .pkl files that are extracted nominal phrases, contextual embeddings of classifiers after dimentional reduction, and extracted nouns from all three corpora respectively.

## Python files
There is one python file to show the process to calculate the dimensional reduced embeddings for each classifier from extract contextual word embeddings from a Chinese BERT model.
